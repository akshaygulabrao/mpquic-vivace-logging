# Graphing cwnd of mpquic vivace
This folder is used for testing and verifying the functionality of PCC Vivace. It contains the script that I use to quickly download the log files from the VM machine AND the python code that I used to quickly visualize how the congestion control algorithm behaves. For any questions, I am reachable at agula002@ucr.edu.
